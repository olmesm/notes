# Java

This is open Java.
This is released by Sun, and there are [no major differences]((http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22358071/differences-between-oracle-jdk-and-open-jdk-and-garbage-collection)) so this will be fine for development.

## JDK
```
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
```

## JRE
```
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
```
