# Make and Ubuntu Virtual Machine

Generally I would recommend VMWare but there's no homebrew package, so I use Virtual Box on Linux/OSX.

| OS | VM App |
|---|---|
| Windows | [VMWare Workstation Player](https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0) |
| Linux/OSX | [Virtual Box](../mac/setting-up/README.md) |
