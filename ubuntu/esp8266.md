## Intall boards manager - Arduino IDE

Starting with 1.6.4, Arduino allows installation of third-party platform packages using Boards Manager. We have packages available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux (32 and 64 bit).

* Install Arduino 1.6.8 from the Arduino website.
* Start Arduino and open Preferences window.
* Enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into Additional Board Manager URLs field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.
* Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and install esp8266 platform (and don't forget to select your ESP8266 board from Tools > Board menu after installation).
* The best place to ask questions related to this core is ESP8266 community forum: http://www.esp8266.com/arduino. If you find this forum or the ESP8266 Boards Manager package useful, please consider supporting it with a donation.

## Uploading files to file system

*ESP8266FS* is a tool which integrates into the Arduino IDE. It adds a menu item to *Tools* menu for uploading the contents of sketch data directory into ESP8266 flash file system.

- Download the tool: https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin/releases/download/0.2.0/ESP8266FS-0.2.0.zip.
- In your Arduino sketchbook directory, create `tools` directory if it doesn't exist yet
- Unpack the tool into `tools` directory (the path will look like `<home_dir>/Arduino/tools/ESP8266FS/tool/esp8266fs.jar`)
- Restart Arduino IDE
- Open a sketch (or create a new one and save it)
- Go to sketch directory (choose Sketch > Show Sketch Folder)
- Create a directory named `data` and any files you want in the file system there
- Make sure you have selected a board, port, and closed Serial Monitor
- Select Tools > ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload. This should start uploading the files into ESP8266 flash file system. When done, IDE status bar will display `SPIFFS Image Uploaded` message.
